# Installation
Most if not all my e2s use custom libraries I've written, which can be found in the library folder.

Place the `library` and `projects` folder in your `steamapps/common/GarrysMod/garrysmod/data/expression2` directory.  

Your folder structure should look like this:  
```
data/
  expression2/
    library/
    projects/
```

Happy coding!
